# Intro to machine learning and data mining - MovieProject

The goal of the project is:

* performing exploratory analysis of an IMDb movie dataset
* implementing a regression model to predict movie ratings
* implementing a classification model to predict the genre of a movie

The project analyses the IMDb movie data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset). The original data set has been scraped from IMDb
(the Internet Movie Database) website on 01/01/2020. It consists of 85 855 movies with more than 100 votes on the website. Every object has 22 attributes. The attributes include for example the title,
year of release, duration, average vote etc. 

The work process and obtained results are described under the /Reports folder.
